# Ethan's CDF review and todo:

**Capability:** Software Engineering
**Role:** Architect
**Next Role:** Senior Architect

# Performance
Each Section show performance metrics as follows:
### Skillset - Current Expectation / Future Expectation / Current Actual

# Mastery
Each skillset in every category of every section is labeled indicating current mastery.

|Mastery|Meaning|
|-|-|
|Mastered|High individual proficiency in skillset, able to clearly teach and apply skill|
|Striving for|Introduced to and focused on learning skillset|
|Not yet acquired|Not focused on mastery at this time and with limit to no prior experience in the skillset|

On each skillset, I either give an example of how the expertise was applied and what the outcome was or reflect on where I am at this time and how I can work towards Mastery.
