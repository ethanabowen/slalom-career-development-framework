# Deliver Excellence

## PEM - 2/3/2

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
  * (2) Facilitates all Agile ceremonies when needed
    * Led every agile ceremony for several years and fill in to help PM/SO when asked or needed
  * (3) Leads Discovery efforts for their capability
    * STAR: As projects begin to spin up in the discovery and early build phases we needed more leadership on task delegation. I stepped up to fill in a less-than-filled SA role for first two projects in order to ensure project stayed the course.   As a result, our team was able to keep a consistent velocity that over delivered on a sprint-ly basis.
  * (3) Refines and prioritizes a backlog based on the product vision
    * As as team lead, I understand the team's capabilities and velocity and how that ties into product vision and upcoming work.  I then prioritize based balancing business needs and team capabilities.

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
  * (3) Be able to coach within Slalom how to successfully execute Agile and PEM (with different clients)
    * Discovery has not gone well with my first two clients and I'm constantly reflecting to understand how to work with different customer environments and cultures.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
  * (3) Demonstrates thought leadership and contributes to pem.slalom.com

## Velocity - 3/4/4

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
  * (3) Takes shared ownership of a product
    * Diligently studying each aspect of a project allows me to communicate to business and team with confidence.  I care about my work, so I make sure I understand what I'm working towards and how we arrive there.
  * (4) Optimizes the velocity of teams through identifying levers to pull
    * STAR: The ending of our sprints were stressful and demos were lackluster.  I started injecting myself into every story to understand the engineering team's strengths and learning points.  With the new information I was able to "target teach" each  individually.  We discussed more communication about what we know and what we want to learn and from then on the team delivered consistently within the sprint and had time to prepare better demos.
  * (4) Evaluates the impact of team culture on velocity
    * Spoken identity into a team to rebuild their confidence and understanding of who they are as a unit and how we as a team will operate.


#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
  * Creates new levers for optimizing velocity

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>

## Stewardship - 3/3/4

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
  * (5) Creates awareness of how the product, code, and documentation we leave behind impacts our brand & marketing after an engagement
    * I believe this to my core and have applied this from a wholistic customer engagement perspective, all the way down to the name of a variable in a function.
    * This speaks to me on a deep level and I am passionate about patiently instilling my peers and clients with this perspective.
  * (4) Understands complete tool chain for building quality product (ALM, CI/CD, IDE, Wiki, Prototyping, etc.)
    * Understanding the whole is important, but not truely achievable without understanding each component and how it relates to the whole picture.
    * Personally coached and created each aspect of the full SDLC

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
  * (5) Establishes a balance between our approach and client's to delivering software products
    * STAR: Our client was resistant to our Agile approches and often requested we do it 'the way it's always been done'.  This type of communication from a client is difficult to navigate.  What I found was that there was a fear of failure with the new way and the project was already under a lot of pressure.  Time and again, I patiently share and taught our team's philosophy regarding Agile and the whole SDLC as we know it.  Before ever sharing my team's perspective, I made sure we had already internally discussed the matter and were in agreement.  I quickly became a voice for the team on these difficult conversations.  The result is not too surprising, the client likes what they see but are still struggling to understand how to adapt our ways into their culture.  Transformations don't occur overnight, so it may be a long time before the mentally of ownership and self-motivation can seep into their employees.

    I didn't always get it right, but time in the consulting field will only harden this skill more.  My first two clients taught me the reality of consulting very quickly.

## Estimation - 3/4/3

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
  * (3) Seeks and considers input from other capabilities
    * Every step of each project and story impacts my teammates in some way.  I pause and ask in group and individually how they are impacted and what their thoughts are on each step taken (where appropriate).  
  * (3) Analyzes needs and capabilities in order to mediate/guide team through collaborative estimation
    * As an active participant and team lead, I make sure to play a respectful 'devil's advocate', even with my own designs, to make sure we all see the each aspect of the system we are building.  

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
  * (4) Evaluates project patterns to assess complexity
    * STAR: As a self professed tech lead and architect, I saw gaps in my knowledge and felt underprepared to solve customer problems at 'acceptable' speeds.  I decided to setup a learning goal for myself and began to actively study for AWS SAA certification and other architecture patterns.  I have now passed the AWS SAA certification and am about to begin studying for the Developer certification.  After passing the exam I feel more confident and have proven that I can 'talk and walk' in real-time with customers and peers on advanced cloud subjects.
  * (4) Evaluates past experiences to make informed decisions
    * While I do this presently, I am continuing to learn about which parts of my past are important to consider given the current situation.
  * (5) Intuits reasonable scope with limited information
    * Understanding my team's capabilities is a pre-req for this.  When I have that knowledge, I have been able to provide more realistic timelines when it comes to team-based projects.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
  * (5) Intuits reasonable scope with limited information
    * Never done this for a LARGE LARGE project, from scratch, for a new client.

## Teamwork - 2/3/4

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
  * (4) Identifies and addresses barriers to teamwork early and efficiently
    * Early detection of gaps in role SA role on both of my projects led to delays in effective work.  I spoke with the individuals my management about possible outcomes.  Both times I was formally asked to fill in the SA roles and be a peer to the one on the project.
  * (4) Instills a sense of purpose for each project
    * Without purpose I, and probably we, feel aimless and dispassionate.  I seek and promote identity and purpose often and early.

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
  * (4) Mediates and resolves conflict with clients
    * As it's easy to identify issues in a company culture, working towards being a force for good in solving these issues is a place I'd like to step into more.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
  *

## Prioritization - 3/3/4

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
  * (3) Collaborates with project leadership to prioritize the backlog
    * As an invested lead, I learn the long-term the business roadmap to assist with prioritization and work capacities.
  * (4) Communicates effectively about business value and risk
    * I make it a point to understand the purpose of every project from a business perspective. So when I'm asked or have to share about deadlines, I have confidence and clarity about impact and outcomes.
  * (4) Communicates the impact of changes in prioritization on the project
    * As a lead, I have had to reprioritize projects around for various reasons.  I have first hand experience in communicating the impact and outcome of the reprioritization.

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
  * (4) Guides the client through hard decisions about scope management
    * I am working on my presentation skills when it comes to these types of decisions.  Mastered for easy decisions.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
  * Manages the impact of scope changes to client relationships
    * Never managed a client directly as an EM/etc.

## Consulting - 2/2/3

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
  * (3) Synthesizes new information quickly
    * This speaks to me.  Whether a new requirement or a pivot from the original, I patiently listen, ask, and absorb the knowledge being shared while making sure I can regurgitate it back out and teach others.
  * (3) Encourages a culture of shared credit
    * I very active say things like "We got it done!", "Go us!", "We are looking into it together", "Our code", "Our responsibility"

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
  * (4) Adapts their message and style to the audience and environment
    * Really good a this, consulting exposure has introduced a higher frequency of new-faces that increases how often this occurs so I'm remaining cognizant of that and adapting/shaping my message more frequently.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
  * (4) Staffs projects effectively based on client and product needs
    * While I think of how to staff a project as early into a gig as possible, I've never been the one to make the final call.

## Predictability - 3/4/3

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
  * (4) Evaluates Agile metrics to identify gaps in predictability
    * Consistent evaluation of team metrics beyond agile, including how present team members are and think of ways to keep the team engaged and chugging along.
  * (3) Sets an example by avoiding heroic delivery
    * Did this too much early in my career.  Didn't get the team advanced, just me.  I have now for many years just stopped, looked over, and talked to my peer about "How are WE going to get this done?  Let's loop in the boss."

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
  * (5) Creates culture of predictability across teams and programs
    * Haven't worked with a multi-program client AT Slalom.  Prior experience had my team with 2 PMs as I lead on prioritization and grooming/etc.
  * (3) Sets an example by avoiding heroic delivery
   * STAR: As I entered into a new 4 week discovery project I saw a significant gap in client requirements and Slalom ideation.  I stepped up, too much.  I pretty much did the job of SO, SA, and tech lead (solo developer) all at the same time.  While we did get to a more steady state eventually, I left a negative impact on the team by doing what others were supposed to (they just weren't).  I didn't want our team to fail and in picking up everyone's pieces and 'Just doing it', I failed myself and created a narrative that I would do the things that were falling through the cracks.  I left a bit of a scar on myself and nutered my own team's individual growing opportunities.  Failure is ok.  Growth is expected.

# Lead

## Self-Management - 2/3/4

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (3) Effectively manages stressful projects
  * STAR: Stress in a project is effectively a lack-of-ownership in a responsibility of one's job.  Working numerous stressful projects, I have been able to identify gaps in my own and others jobs and either begun filling in that gap or sharing the gap with my peer.  The result has always been beneficial for the project.
* (4) Seeks to understand their own motivations

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (5) Coaches others in gaining expertise in self-management



## Client-Management - 2/3/2

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (3) Navigates the organizational dynamics of the client & Slalom team
  * STAR: Our client has an unorganized, unmotivated culture that directly clashes with Slalom's high-noctaine "go get 'em" approach. Because I'm leading some of their engineers, I was my responsibility to carefully navigate those waters to best teach and coach the team.  I held 1-on-1s with the engineers and ever engineers outside my leadership to build a set of "Suggested Best Practices" that ranged from design, communication, code, technology, and so forth.  While the result wasn't a knock out of the park for the organization, it did help to break the mental models of the engineers under my wing.  We've seen new input and ideas from these engineers where previously there was silence and more laid back approach.  
#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* Understand how to navigate different customer culture.

## People Leadership - 2/2/3

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (3) Coaches and mentors team members through challenging situations
  * STAR: My bread and butter.  As a team-focus individual I see this in me on a daily basis.  As an example, our customer presented a conflicting requirement in a harsh way that stunned our time.  I saw that the SO and whole team were feeling lost on how to proceed.  So I scheduled an impromptu meeting by cold-calling everyone in teams and got everyone huddled together to just talk it out.  "How do you feel about that?  What do you think we should do?" etc.  The outcome was a unified message to our client on our approach and a stronger bond within our teams.   Difficult times leads to either unity or disconnect.  Had we just left the meeting and gone away for the day, there was a chance for disconnect  that could hinder the team in the long run.
#### <ins>Striving for</ins>

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (5) Coaches under performing reports to successful outcomes
  * I have a mental block that I’ve been working on about mentoring and coaching those who are older than me by 10+ years.  I have a strong assumption that the time  I am their age I would have learned ”it” by now.  It’s assumptive and  hinders team bonding as a whole.

## Presense - 2/2/2

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (2) Actively contributes in all team meetings
* (4) Succinctly delivers a vision to stakeholders

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>

* (3) Utilizes tools for reflection and growth (retrospectives, DISC)
  * Read Enneagram quarterly and identify on changes in self.
* Coach someone on self-awareness (organically).
* Initiate mass (team) reflection when opportunities arise.

# Grow

## Sales - 1/2/1

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (1) Seeks exposure to sales process, proposals, and SOWs that set
delivery expectations
#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (2) Communicates our expertise in sales conversations with clients

## Business Operations - 1/1/1

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (3) Identifies and aligns teams for opportunities

## Craft - 2/2/2

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (3) Maintains and drives vision of capability
  * STAR: Because there was no initial meeting to level-set the expectations of what we at Slalom Build were going to deliver, the client and our own team had a misunderstanding of what type of "transformation" we were going to deliver.  I consistently asked questions regarding our capability and vision to ensure everyone remains on the same page about our teams' outcomes.  The result was a peace and understanding of why we were working with the client and what the purpose of the job was for them.  
#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (5) Owns evolution and maturity of existing capabilities
  * I'd like to get more involved in the overall SE vision for Slalom Build.


## Culture & Communitiy - 2/3/2

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (3) Expands and maintains a network across Build locations
  * I keep in touch with previous teammates and leverage global slack channels to stay active on SE/Arch topics.

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (4) Shares knowledge and represent Slalom Build at external events
  * This would be an incredible opportunity, I feel I have some ways to go in being confident in presenting on behalf of Slalom Build.

## Recruiting - 2/2/1

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (1) Tells the Slalom story to members of their personal network
  * I do this some, but with Slalom Build's location-lock for Build centers, it's been hard to convince anyone to move.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>

## Strategy - 1/1/1

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* Understands business strategy
#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (1) Understands product strategy
  * Not sure what products Slalom Build offers other than the BUILD approach.
* (2) Seeks opportunities to participate in Build capability specific initiatives.
  * I've spent my initial time focusing on tech and getting into the swing of consulting that I haven't spent as much time on the Slalom initiatives that I'd like.  Finding a balance here is key.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (5) Provides a bridge between Build initiatives and Slalom initiatives
  * Very interested in how Build and Slalom (local) could mesh better together.

# Grow Expertise: Software Engineering

## Full-Stack Development - 3/4/5

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (4) Proficient in at least 1 cloud provider
* (5) Decomposes complex problems into smaller units
  * STAR: Our analytics requirements were just a meeting dump of knowledge and it wasn't clear to everyone how we would approach solving the client's needs.  I very quickly, in real time (I do this often), broke the project down into segments Data Identification and Storage, ETL (S3/Glue/Athena), Analytics NFRs (users, permissions, etc), SLAs, and Business Dashboards.  From this approach we, as a team, were able to talk in a ubiquitous language that set the precedence for project language and structure for rest of the project.  I have done this many times during meetings to help not only myself, but my peers parse out complex problems in real time.

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (3) Known as an expert in a specific technology by peers
  * I am not publicly known as a expert, but more of a swiss army knife.  I will know the tool/offering, but maybe not all the fine details immediately.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>

## Continuous Delivery - 2/3/3

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (4) Automates everything that can be automated
 * STAR: I'm a firm believer in automation.  I joined a new team of skilled engineers and was shocked that no one knew their CI/CD process and it broke often.  My lead and I discussed I look into it since it was beginning to cause me pain as well.  After I got under the hood, I shared that it wasn't doing what they expected and was tasked will a FULL CI/CD rewrite (Jekins/Groovy/Ant/SonarQube).  In a short time, I was able to, from scratch, build out a highly effective CI/CD pipeline with increased observability and error reporting.  Needless to say, our Sprint capacity increased after that!

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (4) Plans/Coordinates data migrations
  * I have not been apart of these kinds of efforts yet.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (5) Guides business decisions for executives on continuous delivery
strategies and release planning
  * A bit outside my scope at this time.

## Quality - 3/4/3

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (3) Guides other practitioners in applying a quality mindset
  * STAR: Developers on my team were not as invested in the quality of our project as I expected.  It was important to keep our quality (UI, test, code, demos, etc) above the pack as our client was expecting a lot.  I put out developers in their shoes, explained their job, their needs, and the impact of positive and negative outcomes.  From there we focused on key areas (UI, code, demos, etc) and how they could be improved.  After a few sprints of difficult code reviews and retrospectives, I saw a big uptick in quality from every aspect of the team.   Our client was happy and growth occurred for our team.

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (4) Defines the quality strategy, timeline, and plan
  * STAR:  Our application lacked significant testing.  As the team lead, I was assigned with cleaning up the bugs in a web based .net app with my engineers.  While I did a fine job at working to identify and delegate the work out, and while the results were very positive, I did not cast a vision or public strategy with my team to keep thinking about the purpose behind the stressful initiative.  I could have done better there and would like to next time.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>

## Security - 2/3/2

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (1) Ensures personal accounts are not used for internal or client access
* (2) Utilizes available automated tooling to test for vulnerabilities

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (3) Assesses and creates threat models for client projects
  * I would like to step more into this realm.  While I understand a relative number of vectors to protect, I have not ever been assigned a task such as this.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (4) Conducts system design reviews with security in mind  

## Architecture/Design - 2/3/3

#### <ins>Mastered</ins>
* (3) Utilizes cloud patterns & principles when architecting applications

#### <ins>Striving for</ins>
* (4) Avoids over architecting a solution
  * To be clear, I like things to be tidy and consistently the same.  Who doesn't!?  This for me is more of Gold/Platinum plating for the client's gain, not baseline requirements over architecting.

#### <ins>Not yet acquired</ins>
* (5) Generates new approaches to architecture for complex systems
  * This is THE dream for me.  As I seek the core 6 AWS Certifications, I'm hoping to be able to build new architecture patterns within my projects, but not holding myself to requiring things be new.
